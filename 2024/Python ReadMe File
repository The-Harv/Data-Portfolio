# Hi all! If you're reading this, it is my first file in my Data Science and Anaylsis Portfolio! 
# I'd just like to start off with staying I currently have limit experience and knowledge of Python, R, Git and GitHub. So, this is very much a learning curve and experience for me.
# I'm hoping it goes well! 
#
#
# A bit of a background for you - I'm currently learnig Python for Data Analysis with the aim of learning it to support my Finance Planning and Analysis (FP&A) career. Therefore the files in here are likely to be wrong, broken, and not the best but hopefully with enough time I'll be able to change that
# Please wish me luck, and stay around for the journey! :)
